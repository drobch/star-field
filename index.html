                   What is a Closure?
                   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

                   A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
                   To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.
                   The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.

                <h5>Why is this question so popular?</h5>

                <p>
                    The inner function will have access to the variables in the outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned.

                    A solid understanding of functional/block scope, anonymous functions, closures, and IIFE’s will definitely make you a better JavaScript developer and help you out in future interviews.

                <h5>Closures’ Rules and Side Effects</h5>

                <p>
                    One of the most important and ticklish features with closures is that the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables even after the outer function has returned. Yep, you read that correctly. When functions in JavaScript execute, they use the same scope chain that was in effect when they were created. This means that even after the outer function has returned, the inner function still has access to the outer function’s variables. Therefore, you can call the inner function later in your program.
                </p>

                <p>Closures store references to the outer function’s variables; they do not store the actual value.  Closures get more interesting when the value of the outer function’s variable changes before the closure is called. </p>

                <p>
                     Because closures have access to the updated values of the outer function’s variables, they can also lead to bugs when the outer function’s variable changes with a for loop.
